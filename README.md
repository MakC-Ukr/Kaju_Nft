Steps that were followed to deploy this:

1. Procedure: Write the contract for the Collection.
2. Upload images using Pinata on IPFS. 
3. Create a JSON database for each NFT, with linking to the corresponding image for each NFT. 
4. Deploy contract and checkout on OS.



NOTE: NFT with tokenId 0 shall not be used.

Contract address: 0x5A2d802ebA5ECeAD46ee7514AD9454F1e515F1bF
Only NFT's with tokenID = 1,2 have been minted by 0x318Edb8407bc022556989429EAC679F1e4001B5c. 
To mint, you can call the contract's publicMintingFunction() function. Total of 999 mints are there. NOT 9999 (as mentioned in description)- it is a check for the more attentive ones xD.


To deploy the contract again: 
1. Drag & drop all the Remix category files to Remix (in "Remix IDE Part" folder).
2. Deploy. As easy as this.
